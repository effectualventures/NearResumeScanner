### Top 3-5 Areas for Improvement
1. **Formatting Consistency**: Ensure all bullet points start with past-tense action verbs, except for the current role. Use consistent formatting for date ranges (e.g., "Oct 2023 – Present").
2. **Bullet Impact**: Some bullets lack quantifiable metrics, such as in the Veridas role. Adding specific outcomes or metrics where applicable can enhance this.
3. **Skills Detail**: While comprehensive, including proficiency levels or certifications (e.g., "Salesforce Certified") could further substantiate skills.
4. **Education Section Format**: Ensure consistency with formatting standards, including detailing any honors, GPA, or relevant coursework if applicable.
5. **International Resume Adaptation**: Avoid cultural-specific terms such as "President’s Club" without context. These may not translate universally.

### Feedback from Stakeholder Perspectives

#### CEO Perspective
* **Strategic Positioning**: Luis is presented as a valuable asset in strategic roles with an impressive track record in revenue generation. Highlight any strategic initiatives or leadership examples more explicitly in the summary to appeal to executive-level perspectives.

#### Design Perspective
* **Visual Consistency**: Make sure there is consistency in bullet point size and format. Visual spacing between sections should be evenly distributed to ensure readability.

#### Sales Perspective
* **Persuasiveness & Impact Metrics**: Emphasize more on results-driven narratives—e.g., "Increased revenue by X% through Y initiative." Use this throughout the resume for a persuasive sales angle.

#### Customer Perspective
* **Clarity & Alignment**: Ensure language is polished and aligns with US business norms, avoiding region-specific terminology or awards without explanation. The resume should easily convey Luis's capabilities in a manner that resonates with US hiring managers.
