1. **Overall Rating (8/10):**  
The resume is well-structured and presents a solid professional narrative. It effectively showcases Luis's accomplishments in business development and sales within the SaaS industry across LATAM and US markets. However, there are areas for improvement, especially in enhancing the quantification of achievements and improving visual consistency.

2. **Top 3-5 Strengths of the Resume:**
   - **Strategic Accomplishments:** The resume highlights significant deals and achievements (e.g., a $1.2M deal sourced).
   - **Relevant Skill Set:** Comprehensive skills section pertaining to business development and sales, including CRM proficiencies and language competencies.
   - **Geographic Market Experience:** Distinct emphasis on experience in both LATAM and US markets, showcasing versatility.
   - **Professional Summary:** The summary is succinct and industry-specific, immediately conveying value by quantifying deal sourcing.

3. **Top 3-5 Areas for Improvement with Specific Suggestions:**
   - **Quantification in Experience Bullets:** Increase presence of metrics across all experience bullets to demonstrate impact. For example, specify percentages, growth rates, or other relevant figures related to cultivated customer relationships or sales strategies.
   - **Visual Consistency:** Ensure formatting consistency (e.g., font size, bullet style) and consider using more whitespace for readability.
   - **Education Section Detail:** The education section fits well but consider aligning with US format norms (e.g., listing GPA more prominently or detailing relevant coursework or honours).
   - **Consistency in Verb Tenses:** Use past tense for all previous role accomplishments and ensure alignment (e.g., "Led" instead of "Lead").
   - **Additional Achievements:** Integrate the additional experience section into the main body with quantifiable metrics and specific examples (e.g., detail the "Presidentâ€™s Club award" with context).

4. **Feedback from the 4 Stakeholder Perspectives:**

   - **CEO Perspective:** The resume strategically positions Luis as a business development leader capable of driving growth. However, the executive presence could be enhanced with more detailed leadership contributions and larger-scale strategic initiatives.
   
   - **Design Perspective:** Visually, the format is a bit dense. Introduce more consistent spacing and margins to improve readability. Consider using section headers with a consistent format (bold, larger font) to delineate sections clearly.
   
   - **Sales Perspective:** While sales achievements are clearly stated, further depth and specificity in metrics would add to the persuasiveness (e.g., percentage growth in sales, reduction in sales cycle times).
   
   - **Customer Perspective:** The resume is aligned with US market expectations in terms of structure and terminology. However, detailing achievements in universal business outcomes (e.g., revenue growth, cost savings) would enhance clarity and credibility.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendation for Implementation:**
   - Consolidate this feedback into actionable next steps: quantify all experience metrics more comprehensively, ensure formatting and tense consistency, and adjust the visual layout for enhanced readability. Implement these changes to strengthen impact and align with market expectations further.
