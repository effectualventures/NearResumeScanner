**Reviewing resume layout**

The user has shared a new screenshot of the resume, so I need to assess any remaining issues. Based on previous feedback, I should mention that the margins are still too wide, though the new screenshot appears to have a narrower margin due to the viewer’s gray border. I’ll also note things like the header, tagline, and alignment issues. Specifically, “PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE” is still embedded in the Skills section, some bullets are missing periods, and languages are not included. I’ll make sure to mention these details for clarity.


Thought for 5 seconds


**Problems visible on the current page-1 render**

* **Margins / printable area** – still \~1″ on every side instead of spec (0.4″ top / left / right, 0.8″ bottom).
* **Header tagline length** – “Senior Estimator & Quantity Surveyor - Diverse Sector Expertise” > 5-word limit.
* **Summary** – single long sentence; requirement is two sentences (< 90 chars each).
* **Skills & Languages block**

  * “Languages” list is missing altogether.
  * “Skills:” run-on paragraph; should wrap to next line after label.
  * **Section divider** (thin gray rule) is double-lined; should be single 1 px #d0d0d0 line like other sections.
* **Professional Experience header**

  * Appears inline at the end of the Skills paragraph instead of its own header line.
  * Needs same bold style and gray divider used for the Skills and Education headers.
* **Company location duplication** – “VIAARQ — Sorocaba, Brazil — Brazil” repeats the country.
* **Date string duplication** – “Jan 2015 – Mar 2021 / Jun 2024 – Present” has two end-date fragments; needs single date range.
* **Bullet punctuation** – many bullets lack terminal periods.
* **Bullet repetition & bloat** – still echoing metrics (“…reducing discrepancies… by 15%” vs “15% reduction…”) and redundant wording across bullets; limit to 7 strongest per role.
* **Education block divider** (page 2) is heavier than Skills divider; must match lighter rule.
* **Footer** – “Presented by near” logo now visible but sits \~⅛″ above bottom; after margin fix, anchor 0.25″ above bottom-most printable area.
