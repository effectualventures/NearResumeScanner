Replit: The attached résumé PDF shows the current output of the converter. Apply the persona-specific feedback below—content, layout, logic—so the generated PDFs fully satisfy each stakeholder.

CEO – meticulous quality control
Tagline too bland; generate role-specific, metric-anchored line: “Senior Sales Development Leader – SaaS & Retail Tech.”

Summary one long line; split into two concise sentences (<90 chars each).

Skills line: add bold labels (CRM: Salesforce | Sequencing: Outreach | Languages: English C2).

Company headers: ensure every role follows “Company — City, Country”; Veridas missing location.

Date format: enforce “Mon YYYY — Mon YYYY” on all roles; Toshiba uses Present, others month spans.

Metrics: every role must display ≥1 quantified result; add % or $ win to Veridas bullets.

Spelling/case: “AltISales” should be “AltiSales.”

Education: show degree, major, institution, year; remove stray comma; add one bullet (e.g., GPA 3.8).

Additional Experience: convert to inline list with dates or remove if space needed.

Currency conversions: verify $1.2 M and $880 K formatting rule (“($1.2 M USD)”) applies everywhere.

Consistency audit: headings weight, bullet periods, verb tense (past except current role).

Designer – layout & brand fidelity
Constrain text column to ~6 in; larger side margins for balance.

Heading style: heavier weight or small-caps; 8 pt top / 4 pt bottom spacing.

Bullet indent 0.15 in; maintain uniform leading.

Verify font: Calibri/Arial 11 pt for body, 14 pt bold for name.

Replace raster logo with crisp SVG in footer; fixed 60 × 15 px; align 0.4 in above page edge.

Horizontal rule under header misaligned—extend full column width.

Ensure PDF metadata set: Title = “Résumé – Luis”, Author = “Near Resume Engine”.

Color palette strictly monochrome + Near blue logo; no unintended grays.

Check for widows/orphans—no single bullet wrapping to second line alone.

Test print preview; confirm one-page at U.S. Letter and A4.

Salesperson – persuasion & authenticity
File name must follow pattern Senior SDR (Colombia) – C-4583.pdf; verify generator logic.

Re-order bullets: lead each role with highest-impact stat (e.g., Toshiba $200 K deal first).

Expand Skills: add SalesLoft, HubSpot, prospecting tools to impress tech-stack depth.

Tagline and summary must feel human; avoid generic phrases (“dynamic business developer”).

Length: one page good; ensure no section feels anemic—Veridas now only three bullets.

Anonymity: confirm no phone, email, LinkedIn present; only first name shown.

Ensure currency notes are believable—no exaggerated totals; align numbers with role scope.

Provide optional quick-copy blurb (one sentence) for AEs to paste in follow-up emails referencing résumé strengths.
