This message includes critical formatting, rendering, and data issues that still persist in the resume output. Please read thoroughly. These are not just design tweaks — some fixes may require changes to backend logic, template rendering, post-processing, and HTML formatting. This needs to be solved at the system level, not patched superficially.

1. ❌ Summary Line Break (Critical Rendering Bug)
What’s happening:
The summary line is broken mid-sentence even though it’s not long. It currently renders like this:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
15+ years in construction estimation with precise budgeting and cost consulting for major infrastructure projects,  
delivering sustained cost efficiencies and project value.
What’s required:

This line should render as one continuous sentence.

Only break naturally if it runs past the max readable width for a paragraph.

This must be fixed in the Handlebars template and/or CSS, likely within .summary.

Why this matters:
This is the first line on the resume. A line break here looks like an error or lazy formatting. It undermines confidence in the overall output.

What to check:

CSS for .summary in the resume HTML template

Any logic that injects line breaks (\n, <br>, or wrapping via max-width)

Post-processing logic that splits lines

Whether this is occurring in the HTML file passed to Puppeteer or caused by Puppeteer PDF rendering

✅ This must be visually tested in both the HTML preview and final PDF.

2. ❌ “Languages:” Label Placement (Broken Skills Section)
What’s happening:
"Languages" is now on its own line — but the label is still incorrectly placed at the end of the last skill, like this:

css
Copy
Edit
...Infrastructure Projects Languages:  
English (Fluent); Portuguese (Native)
What’s required:

“Languages:” must appear on its own line, directly above the list of languages

It should mirror how “Skills:” is formatted

Why this matters:
This section visually breaks and looks malformed. It also introduces alignment and accessibility issues when scanned visually or by screen readers.

What to check:

The Handlebars template where skills and languages are rendered

Any custom helpers or inline conditions that concatenate those two fields

The backend structuring of the resume JSON — are skills and languages two separate arrays?

✅ This should be consistent across every resume, not hardcoded per template.

3. ❌ Currency Formatting Is Incorrect and Confusing
What’s happening:
Currencies are now labeled inconsistently and incorrectly:

“$35 USDM USD”

“$11.4M USD AUD”

“$124M USD BRL”

What’s required:
Pick one of the following approaches and apply it consistently across the entire app, including:

bullet content

education section (if applicable)

backend processing

PDF output

Option A – Use only USD:

bash
Copy
Edit
$124M USD
Option B – Show original + converted USD (preferred if values are based on BRL or AUD):

bash
Copy
Edit
R$124M (~$25M USD)
AUD $11.4M (~$7.4M USD)
Also:

Never stack multiple currency codes (e.g., “USD AUD”, “USDM USD”)

Don’t suffix “USD” if the symbol already implies it (e.g., don’t say “$25M USD” if that’s the only currency format used throughout)

Why this matters:
This currently reads as machine-generated and broken. It hurts resume credibility. Real humans don’t format money that way.

What to check:

Currency formatting logic in the resume transformer function (OpenAI handler or backend)

Post-processing step that adds “USD” — this may need to be removed or modified

Handlebars templates that inject these values

Confirm that values being labeled as “USD” actually came from a BRL or AUD value and were properly converted

✅ You must verify the values, not just the labels. Don’t add “USD” to a number unless it was actually converted.

4. ❌ Resume Header Shows City/State Instead of Country
What’s happening:
The location under the name at the top currently says “Sao Paulo”.

What’s required:

This should say “Brazil” only

Same rule applies to other countries — always use the country name only in the top header

Why this matters:
This is a UX simplification that helps make resumes globally legible and avoids inconsistent formatting like “SP”, “Sao Paulo”, “São Paulo”, etc.

What to check:

The source of the location field in the resume JSON

Any formatting logic in the transformer that selects city/state

Ensure country is extracted correctly and shown in the top section

✅ This should be standardized across all resumes, not patched manually per region.

5. 🔍 Other QA Checks You Must Perform System-Wide
a. Bullet Formatting
Ensure no bullets have currency or spacing bugs

Check all spacing between sections (Experience → Education → Additional Experience)

Check all company/job title formatting is consistent (e.g., Company bold, Job Title italic, Location regular weight)

b. Template Logic
Validate that every change is correctly reflected in:

HTML Handlebars template

Puppeteer-rendered PDF

Resume JSON transformer (backend)

Any post-processing logic (if used)

c. Debug Mode
Before pushing the final PDF, test the intermediate HTML output

Ensure that bugs (like line breaks, currency redundancies) are not already present in the HTML

If they are, fix them upstream — not via CSS hack

✅ Final Deliverable
Once complete, please:

Confirm which fixes were made

List exactly which files were modified (template, API, CSS, backend logic)

Tell Hayden which files to reupload for final verification

No partial fixes, no visual-only workarounds. These need to be actual root-cause fixes so that all future resumes automatically follow these standards.
