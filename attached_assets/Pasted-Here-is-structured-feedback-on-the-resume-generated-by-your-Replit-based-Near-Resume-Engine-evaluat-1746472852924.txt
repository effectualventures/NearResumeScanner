Here is structured feedback on the resume generated by your Replit-based Near Resume Engine, evaluated from three distinct stakeholder perspectives:

---

### üë§ **1. CEO Perspective: Full-Picture Quality & Consistency**

**Strengths:**

* The document presents a coherent structure, with logical section flow: Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, and Additional Experience.
* Experience bullets include concrete outcomes (e.g., ‚ÄúSourced a \$1.2M deal‚Äù), which lends credibility and impact.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Education Section is Incomplete**: The degree field is partially missing‚Äîdisplaying ‚ÄúBachelor‚Äôs Degree, , 2020‚Äù‚Äîwhich undermines professionalism and polish.
* **Company Locations Are Inconsistent**: Toshiba and AltiSales list locations, while Veridas and Incode do not. Standardization is expected for client-facing materials.
* **Summary Could Be More Specific**: The summary is too generic. It should articulate specific industries, client types, or sales environments to contextualize strengths.
* **No Bullet at Education or Additional Experience**: Bullet formatting should be consistent across sections. Additional Experience is presented as a single sentence without formatting hierarchy.

**Verdict**: This version is near client-ready but requires minor revisions to ensure uniformity and detail integrity across all sections.

### üé® **2. Designer Perspective: Visual, Layout & Brand Elements**

**Strengths:**

* The typography adheres to brand standards (Calibri, 11pt) and maintains legibility.
* Section headers are well-separated and visually distinct with appropriate spacing and line weight.
* The footer includes the Near logo in correct position and dimension, maintaining brand fidelity.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Vertical Whitespace Needs Tightening**: The top margin around the candidate name remains excessive, impacting perceived balance.
* **Spacing Between Sections**: Slight inconsistencies in padding between experience entries make the layout appear uneven.
* **Color & Emphasis Hierarchy**: Font styling for job titles and company names lacks contrast. Consider enhancing italics for titles and bold for company names to guide the reader‚Äôs scan pattern more effectively.
* **Skills Section Formatting**: Categories (e.g., "Sales", "Tools") are not clearly differentiated from the skill content. Consider using line breaks or inline vertical bars for improved scannability.

**Verdict**: Aesthetically clean and functional, but refinement of spacing and emphasis hierarchy would improve visual clarity.

### üíº **3. Sales Perspective: Client Impression & Talent Sellability**

**Strengths:**

* Resume conveys upward mobility and relevant international experience (LATAM, U.S.).
* Quantified outcomes (e.g., ‚ÄúSourced a \$1.2M deal‚Äù) are a strong signal of high-performing talent.
* Use of action verbs is appropriate and avoids exaggeration, aligning with a professional tone.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Bullet Depth is Uneven**: Earlier roles (Toshiba, Veridas) contain richer descriptions, while AltiSales lacks detail. Every position should ideally have at least 3 bullets to reinforce perceived value.
* **No Industry Context**: The resume does not provide vertical specificity (e.g., SaaS, FinTech, B2B). Including brief context could significantly enhance credibility and buyer alignment.
* **Skills Section is Underdeveloped**: For a Business Development Manager, tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or outreach platforms are expected. Listing only "CRM" is insufficient.
* **Additional Experience is Vague**: "Participated in marketing initiatives" reads as filler content. Expand or remove.

**Verdict**: With minor bullet enhancements and more detailed tool/context references, this resume would be suitable for client presentation in high-trust sales cycles.
