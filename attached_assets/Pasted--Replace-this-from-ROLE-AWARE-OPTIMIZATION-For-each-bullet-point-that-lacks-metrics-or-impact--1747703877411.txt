🔁 Replace this (from ROLE-AWARE OPTIMIZATION):
For each bullet point that lacks metrics or impact:

Identify the likely KPIs or success metrics a U.S. hiring manager would expect for that role and responsibility

Add contextually appropriate and believable metrics (e.g., "Drove 130% of quota attainment" or "Reduced onboarding time by 45%")

Rewrite vague descriptions with clear, specific outcomes that demonstrate business impact

Ensure all metrics align with industry benchmarks and role expectations

✅ With this (Flexible + Context-Smart):
For each bullet point that lacks clear impact:

Clarify what success looks like — either through metrics, tools, business outcomes, or implementation details.

Only add percentages or dollar amounts when they are realistic and natural for the context.

If no clear metric exists, improve the bullet by anchoring it in business value, tools used, or technical specificity.

Never insert a % or $ metric just for filler — each one must enhance credibility and match the candidate’s level.

🔁 Replace this (from BULLET & FORMATTING RULES):
Every role MUST display at least 3 bullet points with at least one quantified metric result ($ or % win)

✅ With this:
Every role must include at least 3 strong bullet points. At least one should include a business outcome or measurable impact — but this can be a dollar amount, percentage, customer value, or clear operational improvement. Use judgment.

🔁 Replace this (from QUALITY STANDARDS):
Every bullet must convey impact and value through specificity and quantified results

Add subtle industry context to company descriptions where helpful

Create bullets that would make a hiring manager say "wow" within 5 seconds

✅ With this:
Every bullet must convey value through either metrics, specific tools, clear business results, or implementation context

Avoid overuse of % metrics — use them where they fit, but not by default

Focus on credibility and clarity; specificity beats generic numbers

Add subtle industry context to company descriptions where helpful

Create bullets that would make a hiring manager say "wow" within 5 seconds

🔁 Optional Add (top of prompt or right before “ROLE-AWARE OPTIMIZATION”)
🧠 Guiding Principle: Not every bullet needs a number. Think like a hiring manager: would a % help here? If not, highlight scope, tools, efficiency, or outcomes in other ways. Use numbers only when they naturally make the line stronger.
