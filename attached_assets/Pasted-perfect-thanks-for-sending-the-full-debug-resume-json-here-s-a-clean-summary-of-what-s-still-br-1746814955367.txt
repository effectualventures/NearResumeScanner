perfect — thanks for sending the full `debug-resume.json`. here's a clean summary of what’s still broken based on this file and what you should tell Replit to fix:

---

## 🔧 Issues Found in `debug-resume.json` Output

### 1. Summary still breaks early

* The summary is short enough to fit on one line but likely breaks due to template settings like `text-align: justify` or a narrow `max-width`.

### 2. Location at top is incorrect

* `header.location` is `"Brazil"` ✅
* But `header.city` is `"Sorocaba"` and `header.country` is `"Brazil"`
* Make sure template uses **only** `header.location`, not `header.city`, for the top of resume

### 3. "Languages:" label is missing from the rendered resume

* The JSON has a valid `Languages` block:

  ```json
  {
    "category": "Languages",
    "items": ["Portuguese (Native)", "English (Advanced)"]
  }
  ```
* If it doesn’t show, the `resume.html` template may not be rendering it properly

### 4. Repeated verbs in bullets

* Example: VIAARQ bullets repeat “Led” and “Managed”
* These are being passed through `removeBulletRepetition()` in `openai.ts`, but that function only looks for **identical** first words across adjacent bullets — it’s not catching repetition across the whole section

### 5. “Columbia University via Coursera” should be split or clarified

* Current `institution` is:

  ```json
  "Columbia University via Coursera"
  ```
* That’s not ideal — either split it into:

  * `"institution": "Columbia University"` and `"additionalInfo": "Delivered via Coursera"`
  * Or reformat it to `"Columbia University (via Coursera)"`

### Request: Fixes Based on `debug-resume.json`

Here are the changes we need:

1. **Fix Summary Line Breaks**

   * Summary in this file is:
     `"15+ years in civil and infrastructure estimating, excelling in cost control with 28% under-budget results."`
   * It’s short enough to stay on one line but currently wraps early.
   * Please check the `.summary` class in `resume.html` and remove any styles like `text-align: justify`, `max-width`, or forced break helpers.

2. **Ensure "Brazil" Is the Only Location at Top**

   * The header contains `location: "Brazil"` and `city: "Sorocaba"`.
   * Make sure `resume.html` renders **only** `header.location` at the top of the page. Don’t accidentally render `city`.

3. **Fix "Languages" Section Rendering**

   * The JSON includes a `Languages` category with valid items.
   * But the section is missing from the rendered resume.
   * Please double-check the Handlebars logic in `resume.html` to ensure:

     * `"Languages"` category is looped properly
     * It’s not accidentally skipped or overwritten

4. **Improve Bullet Verb Variety**

   * Several bullets in VIAARQ start with the same verbs (“Led”, “Managed”).
   * Please update the `removeBulletRepetition()` logic in `openai.ts` to:

     * Check across all bullets in a role (not just adjacent ones)
     * Avoid repeating action verbs within the same section

5. **Reformat “Columbia University via Coursera”**

   * Instead of:

     ```json
     "institution": "Columbia University via Coursera"
     ```
   * Please format it as either:

     * `"Columbia University (via Coursera)"`
     * Or move "via Coursera" into `additionalInfo` and keep `"institution": "Columbia University"`

Let us know which files you changed so we can re-review.
