‚úÖ Just reviewed the latest output (Senior Estimator ‚Äì Brazil ‚Äì C-22C8) and this one is **significantly improved** in structure ‚Äî but there are still several critical issues. Here‚Äôs a clean message you can send to Replit:

## üîß Final Fixes: Resume Output C-22C8

This output is getting close, but several problems still need to be resolved to meet our formatting and UX standards. These are based on a full code review and PDF inspection. Please implement the following:

---

### 1. **Summary still breaks unnecessarily across pages**

* The summary is short but breaks after the first sentence. This looks bad and wastes space.

**Fix:**

* In `resume.html`, ensure the `.summary` block uses:

  ```css
  page-break-inside: avoid;
  white-space: normal;
  text-align: left;
  max-width: 100%;
  line-height: 1.4;
  ```
* Do not apply `justify` or constrained widths to this line.

---

### 2. **Skills block is fine ‚Äî but ‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù section is completely missing**

* The `Languages` block is present in the JSON:

  ```json
  {
    "category": "Languages",
    "items": [ "Portuguese (Native)", "English (Advanced)" ]
  }
  ```

**Fix:**

* In `resume.html`, add a `LANGUAGES` section after `SKILLS`:

  ```handlebars
  {{#each skills}}
    {{#if (eq category "Languages")}}
      <div class="section-title">LANGUAGES</div>
      <div class="skills">
        {{#each this.items}}
          <span>{{this}}</span>{{#unless @last}}; {{/unless}}
        {{/each}}
      </div>
    {{/if}}
  {{/each}}
  ```

---

### 3. **Resume still hits 5 pages**

* Even with condensed bullets, layout inefficiency is pushing this resume past 3 pages ‚Äî which violates our 1‚Äì2 page rule.

**Fix:**

* In `resume.html`, reduce top margins between sections and add:

  ```css
  section,
  .summary,
  .skills,
  .education,
  .experience {
    page-break-inside: avoid;
    break-inside: avoid;
  }
  ```
* In `pdf-generator.ts`, confirm margins are tight:

  ```ts
  margin: { top: '0.5in', bottom: '0.5in', left: '0.5in', right: '0.5in' }
  ```

---

### 4. **Bullet points still have repeated phrases**

Examples:

* ‚ÄúManaging contracts exceeding \$5M per project on average‚Äù
* ‚ÄúProjects worth over \$6M for religious and educational institutions‚Äù

**Fix:**

* In `openai.ts`, update `removeBulletRepetition()` to scan **all bullets in a role**, not just adjacent ones.
* If the same verb or phrasing appears more than twice, vary or rephrase it.

---

### 5. **Education formatting is clean ‚Äî but CAU BR membership is buried**

**Fix:**

* Pull `"CAU BR Member"` from additionalInfo and render it on its own line under Mackenzie.
  Example:

  ```
  Mackenzie Presbyterian University ‚Äî Brazil
  Architecture and Urbanism, 2009
  CAU BR Certified Architect ‚Äî Since 2011
  ```

---

### 6. **‚ÄúAdditional Experience‚Äù section is missing entirely**

* In previous versions, this line existed:

  > Specialized in estimating and surveying for high-rise residential and multi-purpose infrastructure projects...

**Fix:**

* If the resume includes `additionalExperience`, render it with a clear section title at the bottom.

  In `resume.html`:

  ```handlebars
  {{#if additionalExperience}}
    <div class="section-title">ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE</div>
    <p class="additional">{{additionalExperience}}</p>
  {{/if}}
  ```

---

### 7. **Header is good, but confirm it only uses `header.location`**

**Fix:**

* Make sure only `"Brazil"` (from `header.location`) is shown in the top block ‚Äî not `city` or `country`.

---

Once implemented, please confirm:

1. Which files were changed
2. That PDF output is under 2 pages
3. That all sections render in the correct order

We‚Äôll re-review after that. Thanks.
