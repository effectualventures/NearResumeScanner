Based on the screenshot and context from your Claude-authored implementation documents, here’s feedback on the resume output from three perspectives:

🧠 1. CEO (Full-Picture Quality Control)
This resume does not yet wow. Here's why:

Missing Education Details: The EDUCATION section is just a university name and location. No degree, field of study, or year. This breaks the formatting rules and looks incomplete
.

Inconsistent Bullet Grammar: Some bullets lack periods (e.g. the second bullet under "Truligent"), others have them. Every bullet should end with a period
.

Inconsistent Use of Tense: Past-tense is used in some bullets, but others (like "Provide reporting...") are present-tense even though the role ended. Only current jobs should use present-tense
.

Date Formatting: Not all dates follow the required “Mon YYYY” format. Some might be missing altogether—it's hard to tell from the zoom level.

Summary is MIA: There’s no top-level SUMMARY section. This is required to introduce the candidate and set context
.

No Skills Section: A SKILLS & TOOLS block is also completely missing. That’s a critical part of the Near format
.

No Anonymization or Logo: The candidate’s full name is showing. Client-facing resumes must show first name only, and the Near logo should appear in the bottom right
.

🟨 Verdict: MVP-level pass, but far from sales-ready. Needs structural fixes and polish to meet internal quality bar.

🎨 2. Designer (Visual & UX Design)
From a design lens:

Too Much White Space on Top: There's an excessive vertical gap above the candidate name, wasting real estate on a one-pager.

Header Alignment Feels Off: The candidate name and title aren’t clearly differentiated visually. Add typographic hierarchy.

No Near Branding: The Near logo is not present at the bottom right, violating the design spec
.

Section Header Inconsistency: Some headers (like EDUCATION) are in bold uppercase, which is correct. But others (like Professional Experience) feel visually too close to the job bullets. Needs more spacing or style to stand out.

Bullet Indentation Looks Awkward: The bullets feel slightly off-center—might be a CSS or font spacing issue.

Typeface Feels Generic: Use Calibri or Arial, per spec. Ensure font size is 11pt or 10.5pt if needed
.

🟨 Verdict: Structurally okay, but not polished. Needs tighter layout, font consistency, and visual hierarchy.

💼 3. Salesperson (Client-Facing Credibility)
From a sales usability standpoint:

Doesn’t Scream “Top 1%” Yet: The bullets are bland. They need stronger verbs and quantifiable outcomes (e.g. “Improved process efficiency by 35%” instead of “Helped optimize process”).

Not Believable Yet, But Also Not Impressive Enough: The writing avoids exaggeration (good), but it veers into too generic, which makes the talent seem junior or AI-generated.

Lacks Context: The resume doesn’t explain what these companies are or what industries the candidate worked in. Add context where helpful.

Empty Summary = Missed First Impression: We want the first 5 seconds of a client skimming this to scream “Wow—this person is sharp.” Right now, it just starts cold.

🟥 Verdict: This resume wouldn’t get a client excited. It needs bolder, more confident bullet language and a sharp, punchy summary.
