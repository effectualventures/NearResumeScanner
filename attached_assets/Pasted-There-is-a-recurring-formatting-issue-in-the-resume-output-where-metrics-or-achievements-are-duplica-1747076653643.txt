There is a recurring formatting issue in the resume output where metrics or achievements are duplicated or awkwardly repeated at the end of bullet points, breaking the flow and reducing readability. For example, in the Civil Infrastructure Group section:
"Led the tender analysis for infrastructure projects, accurately setting project scopes and budget estimations that reduced variances by 20%. 20% reduced variances" — the phrase “20% reduced variances” is redundant and appears unnecessarily repeated.

This happens multiple times throughout the document:

“achieving estimation precision of ±5% against final project costs. ±5% estimation accuracy”

“securing contracts worth over $2.8M. $2.8M in contracts”

“achieving an average accuracy rate of 98%. 98% accuracy rate”

“resulted in saving 15% on projected costs. 15% cost savings”

“resulting in trimmed operational costs by up to 10%. 10% operational cost reduction”

“expediting client approvals by 28%. 28% faster approvals”

“contributing to over $20.0M in project deliverables. $20.0M in projects”

“achieving $0.8M in budgetary savings. $0.8M savings”

“increased acceptance rates by over 35%. 35% acceptance increase”

“reducing deviation requests by 15%. 15% deviation reduction”

“leading to an 18% reduction in project timeframes. 18% time reduction”

“enhancing resource efficiency by 25%. 25% increased efficiency”

“negotiating contract savings over $0.6M. $0.6M savings”

“enhancing team performance by 40%. $12.0M project”

This issue likely stems from the prompting logic that redundantly appends a quantified metric after already embedding it naturally in the sentence. Please investigate the relevant generation template or logic that structures bullet content. Identify and fix the logic that is duplicating the metric at the end of the sentence. This may involve checking how performance metrics (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts) are being handled in the generation process and ensuring they are included only once, in the most natural position.

Fix the template and all related prompts or post-processing code to eliminate this behavior going forward. The metric should appear once per bullet point, in a contextually fluent way.
