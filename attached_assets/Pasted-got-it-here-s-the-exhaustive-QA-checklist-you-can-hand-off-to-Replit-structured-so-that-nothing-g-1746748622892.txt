got it. here’s the exhaustive QA checklist you can hand off to Replit — structured so that nothing gets missed and every issue is explicitly verifiable.

this isn’t just a list of what’s wrong — it also includes how to fix, what success looks like, and how to guarantee it’s resolved.

✅ Final QA + Implementation Checklist for Resume (C-2C5A)

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (MUST BE FIXED + VERIFIED)

1. Skills & Languages on Same Line

Issue:
Languages still appears on the same line as the end of Skills, breaking visual clarity.

Fix:
Move Languages to its own line underneath Skills.

What success looks like:

Skills: ...
Languages: ...

✅ Visual gap between the two.
✅ Rendered consistently across all resumes.

2. Summary Line Wraps Incorrectly

Issue:
Summary breaks mid-sentence:

...15+ years in civil and infrastructure projects, achieving cost  
optimizations of up to 30%...

Fix:
Update CSS or layout so the summary line reads as a clean, uninterrupted sentence unless it’s very long.

What success looks like:
	•	No forced line break in short summaries
	•	One flowing block unless overflowed naturally

✅ Can be verified by rendering the first line of the PDF.

3. AUD Currency Format is Unclear

Issue:
Multiple references to “AUD” but no explanation or conversion. e.g.:

	“AUD 11.4M”, “AUD 5.3M”

Fix options (pick one):
	•	Add USD equivalents:
AUD 11.4M (~$7.5M USD)
	•	Or remove AUD and use USD only if approximation is acceptable

What success looks like:
	•	All currencies are consistently either USD or have a side-by-side conversion
	•	Currency appears no more than once per number
	•	No unexplained raw “AUD” values floating in bullets

4. Education Section: Coursera + Columbia Broken

Issue:
Columbia and Coursera are split across two lines:

Columbia University — Online  
Construction Management Specialization, 2025  
Coursera

Fix:
Merge into one entry:

Columbia University (via Coursera) — Online  
Construction Management Specialization, 2025

What success looks like:
✅ Only two lines, nothing hanging
✅ “Coursera” not shown redundantly
✅ Matches formatting of other education entries

🟡 CONTENT & CLARITY ISSUES

5. Summary Language is Weak

Issue:
“Versatile estimator” lacks punch; feels generic.

Fix:
Use stronger lead, like:

	“Construction estimator with 15+ years of experience driving 30% cost savings across civil, commercial, and infrastructure projects.”

What success looks like:
✅ Summary feels like a value prop
✅ No generic adjectives as lead word (“versatile”, “experienced”, etc.)

6. Company & Title Formatting Consistency

Issue:
Some roles have inconsistent layout, italics, or spacing.

Fix:
Use this structure everywhere:

[Company Name] — [Country]
[Job Title] (italic)

What success looks like:
✅ Same styling for all roles
✅ No bolding of location
✅ No missing italics on job titles

7. Section Spacing

Issue:
No consistent vertical spacing between sections, especially around:
	•	Education → Additional Experience
	•	Professional Experience → Education

Fix:
Ensure consistent top margin for all sections (e.g., 12–16px).

What success looks like:
✅ Each section is visually distinct
✅ No sections feel stacked or run together

8. Additional Experience Formatting

Issue:
Content is good, but format is a footnote:

Member of AIQS – December 2023; CAU BR - Brazilian Council...

Fix:
Use bulleted list:

• Member, AIQS – Since Dec 2023  
• CAU BR Certified Architect – Since 2011

What success looks like:
✅ Matches formatting of main body
✅ Each credential is on its own line
✅ Bullets or dashes used consistently

9. Coursera Reference Clarity

Issue:
“Coursera” shows up on its own line
Unclear whether it’s one-off course or part of Columbia

Fix:
	•	If it’s part of Columbia, remove “Coursera” line
	•	If it’s separate, specify course + date:
	“Data-Driven Construction, Coursera, 2023”

What success looks like:
✅ Every line in education block is purposeful
✅ No “orphan” Coursera lines

10. Bullet Density / Sentence Length

Issue:
Some bullets are too dense, especially in VIAARQ and Civil Infra roles

Fix:
	•	Split compound statements
	•	Break long lines into 2 bullets
	•	Avoid 3+ clauses in one bullet

What success looks like:
✅ Every bullet is 1 clear point
✅ <2 lines long
✅ Starts with strong verb, no redundancy

🟢 OPTIONAL POLISH

11. Verb Variety Across Bullets

Issue:
Many bullets start with “Analyzed”, “Conducted”, “Led”, etc.

Fix:
Vary verbs or collapse similar ideas

What success looks like:
✅ No more than 2 identical openers per role
✅ Natural language flow

12. (If m² Is Reintroduced) Add Sq Ft Conversions

Fix:
If a value like “6,000 m²” appears, follow with:

	6,000 m² (~64,600 sq ft)

✅ Use approximate conversion

✅ WHAT TO REPORT BACK

Replit must confirm:
	1.	Which of these were fixed
	2.	Which files were changed
	3.	Which files Hayden should resend for final review
